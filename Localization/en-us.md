        #uksrb-inline-core-0625-title = AARGH-S Advanced Automated Rocket Guidance Hub, Standard
        #uksrb-inline-core-0625-title = The STEADLER AARGH-S core is the latest and greatest in automated guidance, featuring an integrated telemetry receiver and transmitter, a gyroscope that can tell autonomously when the spacecraft attitude changes, and even an experimental guidance system that can autonomously keep the spacecraft at a fixed attitude (required actuators not included).

        // uksrb-inline-core-125
        #uksrb-inline-core-125-title = AARGH-L Advanced Automated Rocket Guidance Hub, Large
        #uksrb-inline-core-125-title = STEADLER Engineering Corps proudly presents the most advanced automated rocket guidance hub, now sized for large space craft. 

        // uksrb-inline-core-1875
        #uksrb-inline-core-1875-title = AARGH-TIXL Advanced Automated Rocket Guidance Hub, Torque Included, Extra Large
        #uksrb-inline-core-1875-title = The most advanced automated rocket guidance hub, for extra large rockets and with extra gyroscopes. In fact, the added gyroscopes on the AARG-TIXL are so powerful that they ably act as actuators and actually affect attitude! Brought to you by STEADLER Engineering geniuses.
