        #uksrb-restock-drone-core-1875-1-description = The most advanced remote guidance unit yet, for even larger rockets and with extra gyroscopes. In fact, the added gyroscopes on this guidance unit are so powerful that they ably act as actuators and actually affect attitude. Brought to you by STEADLER Engineering. Also suitable for attitude control on space stations. (Pending crew rating. Space Station not included).

        #uksrb-restock-drone-core-0625-1-description = The STEADLER RGU core is one of the most complete command units available to date, featuring all the latest guidance systems. STEADLER claims this is the perfect guidance module for the most advanced rockets. (Some assembly required. Rocket sold separately).

        #uksrb-avionicsNoseCone-description = Developed inhouse at the Research & Development Department under the lead of Wernher von Kerman himself, the Aerodynamic Aircraft/Rocket Guidance Hub is the core (not to mention the pride and joy) of the budding space program. It provides radio control, scientific experiments and an integrated power source, and can be used to remotely pilot both rockets and aircraft. Including those that are deemed to dangerous to pilot by even the redoubtable Jebediah Kerman. It even includes an experimental "stability assist system" that can keep the vehicle automatically pointed in a given direction. (If said vehicle has suitable actuators).

        #uksrb-probeCoreSphere_v2-description = The Stayputnik is the answer to the question of "how do we do science in space?". A lightweight sphere equipped with remote receivers and relay control input from the ground to the craft, its built-in batteries provide enough electricity to run experiments for several days before power runs out. Some assembly required. Antennas not included.
