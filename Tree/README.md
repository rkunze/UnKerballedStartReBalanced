# _UnKerballed Start Rebalanced_ Tech Tree
[UnKerballed Start]: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/196589-*

This directory contains the implementation of the tech tree, whis means it defines patches that move all supported parts to their expected position in the tech tree. Parts not mentioned here will end up at the same position as in plain [UnKerballed Start].

## General Design

_UnKerballed Start Rebalanced_ uses the same general tree layout as [UnKerballed Start] (**TODO replace placeholder image link with local image**):

The node names in the tree and the original placement of key parts that have identifiable real-world counterparts suggest a progress through key technologies and achievements:

* Tier 1: first sounding rocket, solid propellants
* Tier 2: jet planes, first liquid fuel rockets, first suborbital flight
* Tier 3: first satellite, return from suborbital flight or low Kerbin orbit
* Tier 4: first crewed space flight, uncrewed Mun/Minmus flyby/orbit
* Tier 5: first space station, uncrewed interplanetary flyby/orbit, uncrewed Mun/Minmus landing, 
* Tier 6: supersonic flight, bigger space stations (laboratory, greenhouse), nuclear propulsion
* Tier 7: crewed Mun/Minmus landings
* Tier 8: ISRU, asteroid mining
* Tier 9: "Orbital Assembly" (orbital shipyard?), "Scientific Outposts" (first permanently crewed planetary bases?)
* Tier 10: Fusion power, fusion propulsion, artificial intelligence, routine off-world resource generation ("Advanced Off-World Mining")
* Tier 11: "Colonisation"
* Tier 12: Antimatter power, "Advanced Colonization"
* Tier 13: Science fiction tech for insterstellar ships

_UnKerballed Start Rebalanced_ generally follows that progress and places parts accordingly.

## Implementation

Implementation (and documentation) is split into several modules organized along thematic lines:

* [`EarlyGame.md`](./EarlyGame.md) for the early game tree up to (and including) tier 3
* [`UncrewedProbes.md`](./UncrewedProbes.md) for probe cores and directly related stuff.
* [`LifeSupport.md`](./LifeSupport.md) for everything that keeps Kerbals alive.
* [`SolarPanels.md`](./LifeSupport.md) for converters from sunllight to electric charge.

* **TODO: Other branches** 

The actual `.cfg` files for the game are autogenerated from the `.md` sources which contain both documentation and individual _Module Mananger_ patches. _Module Manager_ patches in this directory
* _only_ set the `TechRequired` property of a part
* always have `NEEDS[ReStock,ReStockPlus]:AFTER[zzzUnKerballedStart]` to make sure that the patch is only applied if all of the mandatory dependencies are present and is not accidentally reverted by [UnKerballed Start].

Patches that modify parts are handled in the [`Parts`](../Parts/) directory. The documentation of the patch that places a modified part should contain a link to the modification patch.
